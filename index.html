        If you are interested in working with me, please note that I don't have any academic qualifications. I'm not even in college yet. However, this doesn't mean I'm unwilling to work with you. I've been working with computers since I was about 10, and as an autistic person, software development is my special interest!
        <br><br>
        if you want to contact me, my twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/prosandconnors">@prosandconnors</a> and my discord is connor the canoe#1787.

        most of my attention has been drawn towards other areas, so i don't have many ongoing projects at the moment.
