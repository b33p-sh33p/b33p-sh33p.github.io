        you're probably here from my github profile. i don't have much to say here, so you can navigate with the menu on the top!

        or scroll, that works too.

      <div class="pineapple">
        my name is connor, but when i made my github account i put b33p-sh33p as the username. i would change it, but i think the <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/">unintended side effects</a> would not be worth it.
        <br><br>
        my pronouns are he/him, and i am a transgender boy. if you don't know what that is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man">here</a> is a wikipedia article explaining it.
        <br><br>
        if you are interested in working with me, please note that i don't have any academic qualifications. i am a minor, and not in college yet. however, i've been working with computers since i was about 10, and as an autistic person, software development is my special interest!
        <br><br>
        if you want to contact me, my twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/prosandconnors">@prosandconnors</a> and my discord is b33p sh33p#1787.

        most of my attention has been drawn towards other areas, so i don't have many ongoing projects at the moment.
